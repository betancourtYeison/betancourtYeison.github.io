Guidance for Claude Code when working in this repository.

## What this is

Personal portfolio site of Yeison Betancourt Solís, deployed at
`https://betancourtyeison.github.io/`. Built with **Vite + React 19** +
SCSS (migrated from Create React App in 2026-07). It is a data-driven
template (originally based on the popular "software-developer-portfolio"
template): almost all visible content lives in one config file, and
components just render that config.

## Where content lives

- [src/portfolio.js](src/portfolio.js) — **single source of truth** for
  all personal content: greeting/bio, social links, skills, education,
  work experience, projects, achievements/certifications, blogs, talks,
  podcast, contact info. **Bilingual (EN/ES):** language-independent data
  (assets, logos, dates, URLs, tech stacks, display flags) is defined once;
  translatable text lives in `content.en` / `content.es`; `getPortfolio(lang)`
  merges them into the full portfolio object (plus a `ui` map of UI strings).
  To add/change content, edit BOTH `content.en` and `content.es` (parallel
  keys/arrays merged by index). Components read the active-language object via
  the `usePortfolio()` / `useUI()` hooks (never import from `portfolio.js`
  directly except `getPortfolio`/`detectLanguage` in `Main.jsx`). Assets are
  resolved with the local `asset()` helper (an `import.meta.glob` over
  `src/assets/{images,resources,cv}`), not `require()`.
- [src/assets/cv/](src/assets/cv/) — the downloadable CV PDF, referenced
  from `greeting.resumeLink` in `portfolio.js`.
- [src/assets/resources/](src/assets/resources/) — certificate PDFs/images
  referenced from `achievementSection` in `portfolio.js`.
- [src/assets/images/](src/assets/images/) — company/school/certificate
  logos referenced throughout `portfolio.js`.
- [src/_globalColor.scss](src/_globalColor.scss) — global color tokens for
  light/dark themes.

When the user updates their CV, cross-check `workExperiences`,
`skillsSection`, and `greeting.subTitle` (years of experience) in
`portfolio.js` against the new CV — these tend to drift out of sync since
the CV and the site are edited independently.

## Architecture

- Components live in `.jsx` files; plain modules (`portfolio.js`,
  `utils.js`, hooks, contexts, lottie data) stay `.js`.
- [index.html](index.html) at the repo root is the Vite entry; it loads
  `src/index.jsx` (`createRoot`). `public/` holds static files copied
  as-is (favicons, manifest, robots).
- `src/App.jsx` → `src/containers/Main.jsx` composes the page: each
  section (Greeting, Skills, WorkExperience, Education, Projects,
  Achievement, Blogs, Talks, Podcast, Profile, Footer) is its own
  container under `src/containers/*`, reading its data from
  `portfolio.js`.
- Reusable presentational pieces live under `src/components/*`.
  [src/components/reveal/Reveal.jsx](src/components/reveal/Reveal.jsx)
  provides `Fade`/`Slide` scroll-reveal wrappers built on `motion`
  (framer-motion) — an in-house replacement for the abandoned
  `react-reveal`; it honors `prefers-reduced-motion`.
- Dark/light theme is handled via `src/contexts/StyleContext.js`
  (React Context) + `useLocalStorage` hook, toggled from the header.
- **i18n (EN/ES):** `src/contexts/LanguageContext.js` + `useLocalStorage`
  hold the active `language`; `Main.jsx` computes `getPortfolio(language)`
  and provides it. Components consume it through the hooks in
  [src/hooks/usePortfolio.js](src/hooks/usePortfolio.js) (`usePortfolio()`,
  `useUI()`, `useLanguage()`). The initial language comes from
  `detectLanguage()` (browser `navigator.language`, fallback EN) and is
  persisted like the theme. The segmented EN|ES
  [LanguageToggle](src/components/languageToggle/LanguageToggle.jsx) sits in
  the header next to the theme toggle; `Main.jsx` keeps `<html lang>` in
  sync. Note: `index.html` SEO meta/OG stay English (static SPA shell) —
  only rendered content switches.
- Icons come from **react-icons** (tree-shaken SVGs, no CDN): tech logos
  use Simple Icons via an `icon` key in `portfolio.js` mapped in
  [SoftwareSkill.jsx](src/components/softwareSkills/SoftwareSkill.jsx) —
  add new map entries there when adding skills. Social icons live in
  [SocialMedia.jsx](src/components/socialMedia/SocialMedia.jsx).
- Typography: **Inter Variable** self-hosted via Fontsource (imported in
  `src/index.jsx`); the header logo keeps the local Agustina font.
- The header is `position: sticky` (no library). Work experience cards
  render per-role tech chips from each experience's `stack` array —
  note `WorkExperience.jsx` whitelists the fields it passes to
  `ExperienceCard`, so new `portfolio.js` fields must be added there too.
- SCSS uses `@use "..." as *` for `_globalColor.scss` (Dart Sass modern
  module system — do not reintroduce `@import`).

## Optional data fetching — `fetch.js`

Runs automatically before `start`/`build` (see `package.json` scripts).
Controlled entirely by environment variables (see `env.example`, copy to
`.env`, never commit `.env`):

- `USE_GITHUB_DATA=true` + `GITHUB_USERNAME` + `VITE_GITHUB_TOKEN` →
  fetches profile/pinned-repos via the GitHub GraphQL API into
  `public/profile.json`.
- `MEDIUM_USERNAME` → fetches blog posts via `rss2json.com` into
  `public/blogs.json`.

Both generated JSON files are gitignored; the site falls back to
hardcoded data in `portfolio.js` if they're absent. Fetch failures warn
but never break the build.

## Build & deploy

Branch model: **`develop`** is the integration branch (all feature work
lands here first); **`master`** is the production branch that publishes the
live site. Publish by opening a **`develop` → `master` PR** and merging it.
`homepage`/`base` must keep resolving to `https://betancourtyeison.github.io/`
(Vite `base: "/"`).

**Automatic (CI, primary):**
- [.github/workflows/ci.yml](.github/workflows/ci.yml) — on PRs to
  `develop` or `master`, runs `check-format` + `test` + `build`.
- [.github/workflows/deploy.yml](.github/workflows/deploy.yml) — on push to
  `master` (i.e. when a develop→master PR merges) or manual
  `workflow_dispatch`, builds and deploys to GitHub Pages via the official
  Pages actions. Repo setting Settings → Pages → Source = "GitHub Actions"
  is already configured; the `github-pages` environment allows deploys from
  `master`.

**Manual (backup):** `pnpm run deploy` runs `pnpm run build && gh-pages -b
master -d dist`. This is now defunct as a deploy path — Pages serves the
Actions artifact, not the `master` branch tree, so it would only overwrite
source on `master`. Prefer re-running the deploy workflow
(`workflow_dispatch`) instead. **Never run `pnpm run deploy` without
explicit user confirmation.**

Work happens on `develop`; `master` mirrors `develop` at each release and
should not be edited by hand.

Local dev: `pnpm start` (Vite dev server), `pnpm run preview` (serve the
production build), `pnpm test` (Vitest smoke test).

Package manager is **pnpm** (pinned via `packageManager` in
`package.json`; lockfile `pnpm-lock.yaml`). Do not use npm/yarn — no
`package-lock.json` should ever be committed. pnpm-specific settings
(allowed build scripts) live in
[pnpm-workspace.yaml](pnpm-workspace.yaml).

## Known state / tech debt (as of 2026-07)

The full modernization roadmap (redesign, CI/CD, etc.) lives in
[docs/PLAN-MEJORAS.md](docs/PLAN-MEJORAS.md) — consult it before starting
improvement work so changes follow the agreed phases. Fases 1-2 are done
(cleanup + Vite/React 19 migration + pnpm). Fase 3 (recruiter-focused
redesign) is largely done: section reorder, sticky header, react-icons,
Inter, availability badge, stack chips, grouped skills. Fase 4 is done:
the theme toggle animates via the View Transitions API (circular reveal
from the toggle) — `changeTheme(origin)` in `Main.jsx` wraps the state
flip in `document.startViewTransition` + `flushSync`, with the reveal
keyframes in `src/index.css`; it falls back to an instant swap when the
API is unavailable or `prefers-reduced-motion` is set. Fase 5
(SEO/a11y/perf) is done: single `<h1>` (section headings are now `<h2>`),
JSON-LD Person + canonical + `public/sitemap.xml`/`robots.txt`,
`og:image` (`public/og-image.png`, rasterized from `og-image.svg`),
own-branded favicon (purple "Y" monogram, `public/favicon.svg` + PNG
sizes + `.ico`), global `:focus-visible` outline, splash skipped under
reduced-motion, `loading="lazy"` on below-the-fold images, and Lottie
loaded via `React.lazy` (lottie-web is a separate ~80 kB gzip chunk).
WCAG AA contrast: `$subTitle`/`$talkCardSubTitle` were darkened to
`#677079` (≥4.5:1 on white); a `.dark-mode .subTitle` override
(`$subTitleDark #aeb6c1`) keeps subtitles readable on dark backgrounds.
Fase 6 (CI/CD) is done: `develop` (integration) → `master` (production)
model — deploy.yml runs on push to `master`, ci.yml on PRs to both (see
Build & deploy above). Still pending: project screenshots.

Branding assets (og-image, favicons) are generated from the SVG sources
with a one-off `sharp` script — `sharp` is intentionally NOT a committed
dependency; re-add it only transiently if you need to regenerate them.

- `prettier` is a major behind (2→3); `dotenv` (8→17) too. Low risk,
  bump when convenient.
- The Projects/Profile/Blogs sections fetch `profile.json`/`blogs.json`
  at runtime and log console errors when absent (expected fallback
  behavior, inherited from the template).

## Conventions

- Tests: a single Vitest smoke test ([src/App.test.jsx](src/App.test.jsx))
  that mocks `matchMedia` and `lottie-react` — don't assume meaningful
  coverage exists.
- Formatting via Prettier (`pnpm run format` / `pnpm run check-format`),
  config in `.prettierrc` (semicolons on, no trailing commas, double
  quotes). A pre-commit hook (`.pre-commit-config.yaml`) runs the local
  prettier on `js|css|json|scss`.
- Keep content edits in `portfolio.js` data-only; avoid hardcoding text
  into container/component files.
